## Introduction: System Architecture
# System Architecture Overview

## 🏛️ **High-Level Architecture**

### **1. Presentation Layer**  
- **Web Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly web application for desktop users.  
- **Mobile App**: Cross-platform native apps for Android and iOS to enable on-the-go access.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard with visualizations for analytics and management.  

### **2. Application Layer**  
- **Authentication Service**:  
  - Secure login with two-factor authentication (2FA).  
  - Role-based access control for users (admin, accountant, viewer).  
- **Accounting Engine**:  
  - Handles double-entry bookkeeping and ledger management.  
  - Automates journal entries, profit & loss, and balance sheet generation.  
- **Tax Compliance Module**:  
  - GST invoicing and tax filing integration.  
  - Support for TDS calculations and filing.  
- **Inventory Management Module**:  
  - Tracks stock levels, purchase orders, and sales orders.  
  - Generates low-stock alerts and inventory reports.  
- **Notifications Service**:  
  - Automated email and SMS alerts for overdue payments, low stock, and reminders.  

### **3. Data Layer**  
- **Relational Database**:  
  - Stores structured data such as financial transactions, user information, and inventory records.  
  - Optimized for high-volume read and write operations.  
- **NoSQL Database**:  
  - Manages unstructured data like logs, analytics, and user activity.  
- **Backup & Recovery Service**:  
  - Daily automated backups to ensure data safety.  
  - Disaster recovery mechanisms for business continuity.  

### **4. Integration Layer**  
- **API Gateway**:  
  - Facilitates secure communication between modules and third-party services.  
  - Supports RESTful APIs for integrations with banks, tax portals, and payment gateways.  
- **Third-Party Services**:  
  - Payment Gateway for online transactions.  
  - Government APIs for GST and TDS filing.  
  - SMS/Email Service Providers for notifications.  

### **5. Security Layer**  
- **Encryption**:  
  - Data encrypted at rest and in transit using industry standards like AES-256 and TLS.  
- **Firewall and Threat Monitoring**:  
  - Protects the system against unauthorized access and cyber threats.  
- **Access Control**:  
  - Implements least-privilege access and regular audits.

## 🌟 **Deployment Model**  
- **Cloud-Based Hosting**:  
  - Scalable architecture deployed on AWS/Azure/GCP for flexibility and reliability.  
- **Microservices Architecture**:  
  - Independent modules for scalability and fault tolerance.
